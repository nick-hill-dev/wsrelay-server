# WebSocket Relay Server

The WebSocket Relay server is a node-based websocket communications server enabling users across different web browsers and machines to communicate with each other, often for the purpose of collaboration. For example, WSRelay enables online chat or multiplayer gaming between groups of people without the machines needing to have knowledge of each other directly. Users can simply load a web page and are connected to each other.

Web pages that make use of a WebSocket Relay server must understand and transmit messages using the WebSocket Relay protocol. The WebSocket Relay protocol is described in detail in the [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) file. The [WebSocket Relay Client library](https://github.com/nick-hill-dev/wsrelay-client) can be used to simplify communications to and from a WebSocket Relay server in your client applications.

## Quick Start

1. Prepare Development Environment: `npm install`
1. Run with `npx` and TypeScript: `npx ts-node src/app.ts`

Alternatively, instead of using `npx` and `ts-node` you can build via TypeScript and run directly:

```bash
tsc -b
node bin/app.js
```

Or, build a Docker container:

```bash
tsc -b
docker build -t wsrelay:latest . # For Raspberry Pi add this parameter: --platform linux/arm64/v8
docker run wsrelay:latest # If you want to run it now
```

## Features

- Allows web browsers on different machines to communicate with one another via the relay.
- Groups of people can be segregated into different groups, aka "realms".
- Can send messages to everyone in a realm, everyone in a realm except yourself, or to specific people currently residing within a realm.
- Receive notifications when people join or leave a realm.
- Receive notifications when child realms begin to exist or are deleted.
- Distinction between permanent realms and temporary realms.
- Can create or join child realms belonging to a parent realm, in a tree-like structure.
- Can save data to realms and load data from them.
- Support for communication across different realms.
- Can implement custom protocols on top of the basic WebSocket Relay protocol for highly customised applications.
- Can specify which specific origins to accept, or all.
- Can specify which specific websocket protocols to accept, or all.
- Can operate as a Docker container.
- Can run on a Raspberry Pi, as a Docker container or as a node application.

## Configuration

The service is configured via config.json as follows:

```jsonc
{
    "port": 22002, // The port number to listen on for incoming connections.
    "acceptedOrigins": [ // A list of strings describing which origins will be accepted.
        "http://127.0.0.1" // Another example: "https://my.website.com".
    ],
    "acceptedProtocols": [ // A list of strings describing which protocols will be accepted.
        "*" // This accepts all protocols.
    ],
    "publicRealmCount": 65536, // The number of reserved realms, where data is not deleted, and temporary realm IDs are above this number.
    "entityPath": "./data", // The location of where to store data that clients have asked to save on the server, I.E. game state etc.
    "logIncoming": false, // Indicates whether or not to write messages to the console based on what messages the server has received.
    "logOutgoing": false // Indicates whether or not to write messages to the console based on what messages the server has sent.
}
```

## Example Usage

See [demo/index.html](demo/index.html) for an example on directly calling the server, without support of the [WebSocket Relay Client library](https://github.com/nick-hill-dev/wsrelay-client). Use cases like this require comprehensive understanding of the [protocol](PROTOCOL.md).

## Secure WebSocket

There is no direct support for the wss:// protocol at present but it is possible to set up a proxy to transform wss traffic into ws traffic. Example below describes what changes need to be made to an existing SSL host in the apache2 configuration file:

```xml
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ...
    ProxyPass "/wsrelay" "ws://example.com:12345/wsrelay"
    ...
</VirtualHost>
```

## C# Version (2019)

The original version of WebSocket Relay server was created many years ago and originally published as a part of the "Social Poker" solution [released in 2019](https://github.com/nick-hill-dev/social-poker) (under the `Application Server/WSRelay/(mono)` folder). This repository is a complete rewrite of that C# version in order to improve stability and make it simpler to use and configure. This version of the WebSocket Relay server retains 100% compatibility with the original.
